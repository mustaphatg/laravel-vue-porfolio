### MY Laravel and Nuxtjs portfolio
<p> This porfolio was created using Laravel on the backend and Nuxtjs on the front-end. </p>
<p>The purpose of Laravel here is to add, edit, update and delete my projects from the database. Laravel also provides the api that the Nuxtjs on the front-end consumes.</p>

            <p class="sm:p-3 md:p-5 font-semibold md:text-xl ">
                With 3 years of web development under my belt and a passion for
                the LAMP stack technology, I offer daily support and expertise in PHP.

                <br /><br />
                My journey began as a 3D animator, where I discovered the power
                of Python and C++ through my work with Blender software. Fueled
                by my thirst for knowledge, I delved into the world of
                programming, choosing Django as my framework of choice and
                creating numerous mini-project with Python/Django.

                <br /><br />
                Realizing what I could do with programming inspired me to
                abandon animation in favor of a career in web development.That's
                when I stumbled upon PHP and was immediately drawn to its
                versatility and robust ecosystem. As a skilled PHP developer, I
                craft backend solutions with the likes of PHP, Laravel, MySQL,
                and PostgreSQL, and bring front-end flair with ReactJS or VueJS.
                I'm a lifelong learner, always seeking new challenges and
                exploring how different technologies can come together to create
                comprehensive web development solutions.
